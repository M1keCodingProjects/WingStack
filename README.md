# WingStack
The WingStack IDE project is an Integrated Development Environment for my proof-of-concept language "WingStack". Write your code, see it highlighted in real time and run it with its javascript interpreter.

WingStack is a Stack-based interpreted language making use of RPN (Reverse Polish Notation) for operation priority, heavily inspired by the Porth project: https://github.com/tsoding/porth
