# GLIDE
GLIDE.js is an Integrated Development Environment for my proof-of-concept language "GameLang". Write your code, see it highlighted in real time and run it with its javascript interpreter.

GameLang is a Stack-based language making use of RPN (Reverse Polish Notation) for operation priority, heavily inspired by the Porth project: https://github.com/tsoding/porth
